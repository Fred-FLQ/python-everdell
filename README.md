# Python Everdell

Python Everdell is a Python program designed to emulate some of Everdell's game mechanics. It has been **created solely for the purpose of learning Python**.

If you're not familiar with Everdell, I recommend visiting BoardGameGeek [page](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell). If you enjoy resource management and worker placement board games, it's really good!
