## Introduction

Python Everdell is a Python program designed to emulate some of Everdell's game mechanics in the terminal. It has been **created solely for the purpose of learning Python**. Python Everdell wil evolve along with my Python and front-end skills (thinking about Django). At least, that's the plan!

Note: If you're not familiar with Everdell, I recommend visiting BoardGameGeek [page](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell). If you enjoy resource management and worker placement board games, it's really good!
