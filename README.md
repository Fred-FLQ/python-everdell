## Project Description & Purpose

Python Everdell is a terminal-based Python program designed to emulate some of Everdell's game mechanics. It has been **created solely for the purpose of learning Python** as part of my Codecademy course. Python Everdell might evolve along with my Python and front-end skills (thinking about Django). At least, that's the plan!

Note: If you're not familiar with Everdell, I recommend visiting BoardGameGeek [page](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell). If you enjoy resource management and worker placement board games, it's really good!

## Features & Limitations

### Features
For this version of Python Everdell, 2 players can:
 - [x] get random cards from the deck at the begining of the game
 - [x] display their repective town and cards in hand information
 - [x] play a card and get victory points (no resources required)
 - [x] quit the game

### Limitations
 - [x] I populated the json file with future features in mind but most of the data is not exploited yet.
 - [x] You can't place your workers yet...
 - [x] ... meaning you can't get resources on your own. Hence the "free" cards for now. ;)
 - [x] It's not really a game since Victory Points doesn't mean much because of the "free" cards.

## Technologies & Tools

Nothing fancy here: Python3 and a json file to store Everdell's cards information.

For Python 3, note that I only used concepts covered by the Codecademy [Learn Python 3 course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). Only two exceptions: Python 3's F-strings (much better to format strings) and the exit() function.

Here are the tools I used:
 - [x] [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - [x] GitHub (you are there already!)
