## Project Description & Purpose

Python Everdell is a terminal-based Python program designed to emulate some of Everdell's game mechanics. It has been **created solely for the purpose of learning Python** as part of my Codecademy courses. Python Everdell will evolve along with my Python and front-end skills (thinking about Django). At least, that's the plan!

Note: If you're not familiar with Everdell, I recommend visiting BoardGameGeek [page](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell). If you enjoy resource management and worker placement board games, it's really good!

## Features & Limitations

<coming soon>

## Technologies & Tools

Nothing fancy here: Python3 and a json file to store Everdell's cards information.

Here are the tools I used:
 - [x] [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - [x] GitHub (you are there already!)
